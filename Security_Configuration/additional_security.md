# Additional Security Measures

## 1. Network Access Control (NAC)
Network Access Control (NAC) policies are enforced to ensure only authorized devices can connect to the network. Devices are scanned for security compliance before granting access.

## 2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Two-factor authentication is mandatory for accessing the VPN and other critical network services. This helps protect against unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.

## 3. Endpoint Protection
Each device connected to the network has endpoint protection installed, including antivirus, anti-malware, and intrusion detection software. This ensures that the devices are safe from attacks and do not become weak links in the network.

## 4. Regular Patch Management
A patch management system is in place to ensure all network devices and servers receive the latest security updates. Critical vulnerabilities are addressed within 24 hours of patch release.

## 5. Data Encryption
All sensitive data transmitted over the network is encrypted using SSL/TLS. This prevents eavesdropping and ensures data integrity.

## 6. Strong Password Policies
Password policies enforce the use of complex passwords that are rotated every 60 days. Passwords must meet length and complexity requirements, and password history is enforced to prevent reuse.
