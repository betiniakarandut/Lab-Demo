# 🛡️ Task C: Configure Network Security for a Secure Network in a Coporate Environment🛡️

## 🚀 Introduction

In **Task C**, we focus on implementing crucial security measures for a corporate network environment. This task is essential to ensure robust protection against various cyber threats and improve the resilience of the network. We will cover setting up a **VPN**, configuring **Fail2Ban**, and defining **Firewall Rules** to harden network security.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Set up VPN**: Establish a secure communication tunnel to encrypt data transfer.
2. **Implement Fail2Ban**: Defend against brute-force attacks by monitoring logs and banning suspicious IPs.
3. **Configure Firewall Rules**: Define rules to permit or deny traffic and protect critical network infrastructure.

## 📂 File Overview

This task includes the following files for easy deployment:

- **`vpn_setup_guide.sh`**: Automates VPN setup for secure remote access.
- **`fail2ban_config.sh`**: Script to configure Fail2Ban and block unauthorized access.
- **`firewall_rules.sh`**: Enforces security with robust firewall policies.
- **`additional_security.md`**: Documentation of extra security protocols for added protection.

## 🔐 VPN Setup

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is crucial to safeguarding data transmission across the network. In this task, we configure a VPN to establish secure connections for remote employees, providing encrypted data transmission and minimizing vulnerabilities.

### ✨ Features
- **Secure Tunneling**: Encrypts all data sent across the network.
- **Remote Access**: Securely connects remote workers to the corporate network.
- **User Authentication**: Implements multi-factor authentication for added security.

### 💻 How to Execute:
```bash
sudo bash vpn_setup_guide.sh
```

## 🔒 Fail2Ban Configuration

Fail2Ban is designed to protect your system from brute-force attacks by monitoring failed login attempts and banning suspicious IP addresses. In this task, we configure and fine-tune Fail2Ban to meet specific corporate security needs.

### ✨ Features
- **Log Monitoring**: Tracks failed login attempts from logs.
- **IP Banning**: Automatically bans malicious IPs after failed attempts.
- **Customizable**: Adjust ban durations and monitoring frequency.

### 💻 How to Execute:
```bash
sudo bash fail2ban_config.sh
```

## 🔥 Firewall Rules

Firewall rules form the foundation of network security, filtering traffic based on IPs, protocols, and port numbers. In this task, we enforce strict firewall rules to block unauthorized access while allowing legitimate traffic to flow smoothly.

### ✨ Features
- **Traffic Control**: Manages incoming and outgoing traffic efficiently.
- **Security Zones**: Segments the network to isolate sensitive information.
- **Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access to vital systems.

### 💻 How to Execute:
```bash
sudo bash firewall_rules.sh
```

## 🔍 Additional Security Protocols

In **`additional_security.md`**, we provide extra steps and recommendations for enhancing the network's security posture. This includes implementing:
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: To monitor suspicious activities.
- **Data Encryption**: To secure all sensitive information stored in the network.
- **Access Control**: To limit user access based on roles.

---

## 📜 Conclusion

Task C completes the security-focused implementation for a corporate network. By deploying **VPN**, **Fail2Ban**, and **Firewall Rules**, we significantly enhance the network’s security, ensuring it is resilient to both external and internal threats.
