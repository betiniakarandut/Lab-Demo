# Security Measures for the Corporate Network

This document outlines the essential security measures to protect the corporate network from cyber threats and ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network resources.

## 1. Network Segmentation Using VLANs

### Virtual LAN (VLAN) Implementation
- VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) segregate network traffic into isolated segments, minimizing broadcast traffic and reducing the attack surface.
- Key VLANs:
  - **HR VLAN**: Isolated traffic for HR-related devices (laptops, printers).
  - **Guest VLAN**: Separate network for guest devices such as smartphones.
  - **Server VLAN**: Segmented traffic for server communications and applications.
  - **VoIP VLAN**: Isolated traffic for VoIP communication, minimizing interference.

### Benefits:
- Reduces broadcast traffic and risk of VLAN hopping attacks.
- Enhances security by isolating network segments and implementing access control.
  
## 2. Firewalls

### Role of Firewall
- The firewall acts as the first line of defense, inspecting incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)**: Utilized for deep packet inspection and application layer filtering.

### Firewall Security Rules:
- **Block Unused Ports**: All non-essential ports should be closed to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Outbound Rules**: Implement strict outbound rules to prevent sensitive data exfiltration.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**: Use NGFW features for threat detection and blocking.

## 3. Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Employees are assigned specific roles with permissions relevant to their job functions.
- Least-privilege principle: Users are granted the minimum necessary access to perform their tasks.

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- ACLs are configured on network devices such as routers, firewalls, and switches to filter traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

### Authentication:
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implement 2FA for critical systems to prevent unauthorized access.
- **SSH Key Authentication**: Use public/private key pairs for secure login to network devices.
  
## 4. VPN for Remote Access

### Secure Remote Access
- Virtual Private Network (VPN) is deployed for secure remote access to corporate resources.
- **IPsec VPN**: Encrypts data between remote users and the internal network to protect sensitive information from eavesdropping.
- **SSL VPN**: Provides browser-based access for external employees using SSL/TLS encryption.

### VPN Best Practices:
- Use strong encryption protocols (AES-256).
- Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for VPN users.
- Regularly update VPN software and patches.

## 5. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

### IDS/IPS Deployment
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and generates alerts.
- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**: Actively blocks identified threats in real-time.

### Best Practices:
- Regularly update IDS/IPS signatures to identify new vulnerabilities.
- Fine-tune detection rules to reduce false positives and negatives.
- Log all incidents for forensic analysis.

## 6. DNS Security

### Securing DNS
- Implement DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to ensure the integrity and authenticity of DNS data.
- Configure **split DNS**: Separate internal and external DNS queries to prevent DNS spoofing attacks.
  
### Best Practices:
- Use secure DNS resolvers to protect against DNS hijacking.
- Regularly audit DNS configurations and apply patches for known vulnerabilities.

## 7. Patch Management

### Regular Updates
- All network devices, including firewalls, routers, switches, and end-user systems, must be patched regularly to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- Implement automated patch management tools to schedule and verify updates.

## 8. Data Encryption

### Data-in-Transit and Data-at-Rest Encryption
- Use **SSL/TLS** to encrypt all data-in-transit between client devices, applications, and servers.
- Implement **disk encryption** (e.g., BitLocker) on critical servers and laptops to secure data-at-rest.

## 9. Network Monitoring and Logging

### Real-time Monitoring Tools
- Deploy real-time monitoring tools (e.g., **Zabbix**, **Nagios**) to track network performance and detect anomalies.
- Enable **Syslog** for centralized logging of all network activities.

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Implement SIEM solutions to aggregate, analyze, and act upon security events in real-time.

## 10. Backup and Disaster Recovery

### Backup Solutions
- Ensure automated backups of critical systems and data are performed regularly.
- Use **offsite and cloud-based backups** to ensure data recovery in the event of a disaster.

### Disaster Recovery Plan
- Implement a comprehensive disaster recovery plan with defined **Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)** and **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)**.

## 11. Employee Security Awareness

### Security Training
- Regularly conduct security awareness training for all employees on phishing attacks, social engineering, and the importance of strong passwords.
  
### Policy Enforcement:
- Ensure compliance with the company's security policies and protocols, including acceptable use policies for corporate devices and networks.

By implementing these security measures, the corporate network will be better equipped to handle modern cybersecurity threats while maintaining robust performance and availability.
